							<p>Without our amazing technical crew, the theatre wouldn't be the same. The lights wouldn't run, there would be no audio, so people would have to shout to address people, no followspots, and no backstage people.</p>
							<p>Basically if there was no theatre crew the theatre couldn't run. This is a page introducing our adult staff, and what they do. So, next time you are watching one of our amazing shows, think about our skilled
							technical crew.</p>
							<br>
							<h2>Jeremy Ruemler</h2>
							<h3>Technical Director</h3>
							<p>Jeremy got his start in his high school theatre in Flora, Indiana. Once he graduated, he went into the computer repair business,<br>
							but soon after went into technical theatre. His first real technical theatre job was a stagehand at the Long Center for Performing Arts.<br>
							And, now he is technical director there. In 2011, Jeremy was hired at Lafayette Jefferson High School as the Technical Director. <br>
							The theatre is now much better, and he has made numerous upgrades to the lighting system, sound system, and much, much, more.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>James Holsclaw</h2>
							<h3>Assistant Technical Director / FEXTech Technical Director</h3>
							<p>James started working at the theatre when he was in high school. When he graduated, he joined the Marines. In 2014, after his career <br>
							in the Marines was over, he was hired at RPAC as the Assistant Technical Director and FEXTech Technical Director.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Martin Fernandez</h2>
							<h3>Theatre Manager</h3>
							<p>Martin, or known by his students as "Fern," is an English teacher at Jefferson high School. In the theatre, Martin works with <br>
							the busy and complex theatre schedule. Without him, we would have multiple groups coming in and saying they reserved the theatre.<br>
							The theatre truly couldn't function without the help of Martin.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Linda Cleveland</h2>
							<h3>Stage Manager, Set Builder, Concessions</h3>
							<p>She began backstage at Rossville School at age 16 as a stage manager.  After BS and MS degrees in Business Education and<br>
							Accounting from Indiana University, she began teaching at Rossville High School. She retired from teaching 3 years ago while<br>
							staying in the Theatre Department for 3 more years with 180 shows on her resume.  She was also the Auditorium Director at Rossville<br>
							from 1999 through 2015. That represents many years of directing, rehearsals, moving flats, blocking and set design. After retirement,<br>
							she was fortunate to become a member of the Rohrman Performing Arts Center and the Long Center of Performing Arts. Becoming Stage Manager<br>
							was like going full circle since she was 16 years old.<p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Tom Rayner</h2>
							<h3>Ticketing, Video, Concessions</h3>
							<p>Tom works with our ticketing system, and with our video team who make amazing recordings of our shows. Tom started working<br>
							at Jeff before he got involved with theatre. His main job at Jeff is working in Guidance, and with the IT team at Jeff. When we<br>
							have any shows that require ticketing, you can count on Tom to be there.</p>
							<br>
